As of this writing, the package is a work-in-progress and heavily in development. Structure and syntax will likely change prior to a formal release.

If you do scare up the courage to install this and try commands, I would love your feedback, please log issues and concerns here in the GitHub repository.

## Installation

In this early stage I clone the repository to a local folder and then:

-   Create and activate the dev environment:

    `virtualenv dev_env`

    `source dev_env/bin/activate`

-   Navigate to the local folder with the cloned contents from Github:

    `cd “C:\Local Documents\Github\AppliedVibrationAnalysis”`

-   Use `pip` to install the package (note the ‘`.`’ at the end):

    `pip install -e .`

I verified these instructions in Windows 11, but it should be similar for other operating systems.
